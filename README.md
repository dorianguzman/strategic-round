## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

The digital marketing landscape has a critical gap: micro-influencers deliver targeted engagement but are costly to scale manually. QStarLabs removes this complexity with our AI-powered solution.

## 💡 Our Solution: PERSONAS Platform

- **White-glove AIaaS** with managed deployment
- **Enterprise integrations** for iGaming — odds API, pre-built bet slips, promotion highlights
- **Reinforcement learning** drives audience engagement
- **Pulse on trending** topics to capture demand

## 🚀 Proven Results

### Case Study: Divina (Divvy.bet)

## 💼 Business Model

### Revenue Share
Share of influencer-generated revenue (or CPA) with a monthly minimum to cover compute

### Metering
Compute cost plus markup

Both models allow QStarLabs to scale profitably and capital-efficiently.
